# research
A place to keep your research and share it with the group

## Getting Started

Please add a link to any research that you complete as we go by editing this document and putting it under the relevant week. It's a good idea to get comfortable writing markdown, so we'd love for you to try out Hackmd.io which is a markdown text editor which allows collaboration.

## Research

### Week 1 - Fundamentals 1


### Week 2 - Fundamentals 2


### Week 3 - Node.js 1


### Week 4 - Node.js 2
